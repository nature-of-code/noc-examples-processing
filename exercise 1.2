I am not a "coder"! I am an artist. I was interested in 'Processing'. 
The-Nature-of-Code-Examples (http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/)
'Example I.2: Random number distribution' is faulty! When you "reset" the bargraph, 
the bars start leaping up & down until you reload the web-page. This does not encourage 
me...(I wonder how many others have been put off by this error in the "Introduction"
to Processing? Also - I am not a "git", but this github is not user-friendly for the non-coder...
Here is the code:


//Example I.2: Random number distribution
//An array to keep track of how often random numbers are picked
int[] randomCounts;
 
void setup() {
  size(640,240);
  randomCounts = new int[20];
}
 
void draw() {
  background(255);
 

//Pick a random number and increase the count.

  int index = int(random(randomCounts.length));
  randomCounts[index]++;
 
  stroke(0);
  fill(175);
  int w = width/randomCounts.length;

//Graphing the results

  for (int x = 0; x < randomCounts.length; x++) {
    rect(x*w,height-randomCounts[x],w-1,randomCounts[x]);
  }

}
